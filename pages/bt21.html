            BT21 is a project collaboration between BTS and Line Friends created on September 26, 2017. Rather than
            simply creating avatars based on the physical appearances of the artists, BT21 consists of 8 unique and
            charming characters: KOYA, RJ, SHOOKY, MANG, CHIMMY, TATA, COOKY, and VAN. The members of BTS actively
            participated in the process of designing and naming the characters as well as their origin stories. The
            popularity and rapid growth supported by fans have led to the expansion of the brand into the BT21 UNIVERSE.
            Fans can buy the BT21 merchandise online and on-site at LINE FRIENDS stores.
            <br><br>
            BT21 also has numerous collaborations with other brands, allowing fans to have a unique experience as well
            as enjoy quality products and digital presence in the forms of animated content and games!
            <br><br>
